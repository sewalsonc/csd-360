            I <span id="work">__________</span> at WITCC.  I get to do all kinds of stuff, like building curriculum
            , creating training equipment, teaching, get training myself, and many administrative things.  Sometimes, 
            like everyone I assume, I think about what it would be like to find a new career but soon remember how 
            good it really is at the college.  <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('work').innerHTML = 
            Value1">Click to fill in the blank</button><br/>

        <p>
            We live in a house that was built around the turn of the century and a couple of decades ago it was only 
            a small two bedroom.  Our <span id="home">____________</span> now has 5 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.  I have 
            done tons of work on our house over the years.  <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('home').innerHTML = 
            Value2">Click to fill in the blank</button><br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Another special part of my life is my <span id="family">___________</span>.  Our household  
            is getting smaller as my kids grow up and my wife and I try to spend as much time as possible with our kids 
            before they all move out.  On two left in the house out of 3.  Not looking forward to them all living out on 
            their own.  <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('family').innerHTML = 
            Value3">Click to fill in the blank</button><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            My son and I like to spend our spare time working on <span id="toys">___________________</span>.  When I find a 
            fun project and I am into it, time kind of melts away.  And after I finish I usually get to enjoy by crusing or 
            using it.  I love to rebuild small engines and equipment and make them look new again.  
            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('toys').innerHTML = 
            Value4">Click to fill in the blank</button><br/>
