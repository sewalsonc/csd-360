                For this assignment we are to create a webpage with multiple 
                elements that will be altered by user events such as:<br><br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mouse Button Clicks.</li>
                    <li>When a Mouse Button is Pressed or Released</li>
                    <li>Hovering over Elements on a Page.</li>
                    <li>When a Keyboard Key is Pressed.</li>

    <!-- Description of images -->
        <p>
            The images below are a couple of my favorite things. They are two of the 
            things that I like to spend my time with or doing.<br> <br />
            The first image is of an apple orchard.  Orchards and other green spaces 
            such as this can bring you serenity and mental clarity by just being in them.
            <br>Hover your mouse over the image of the orchard to view the photo.
        </p>

        <div>
            <a href=#
               onmouseover="orchard.src='Apple-OrangeA.jpg';"
               onmouseout= "orchard.src='Apple-OrangeB.jpg';"
            >
              <img border = 0 name = "orchard" src = "Apple-OrangeB.jpg">
            </a>
        </div>
        <br />

        <p>
            The second picture shown below is of a 1970 Chevy Chevelle.  I love 
            classic cars and have had many over the years.  Probably one of my 
            favorite things about classic cars is fixing them up and getting 
            back on the road.<br>Click on the image below to change the image.

        <div>
            <a href=#
               onmousedown="classics.src='RedChevelleB.jpg';"
               onmouseup= "classics.src='RedChevelle.jpg';"
            >
              <img border = 0 name = "classics" src = "RedChevelle.jpg" width="900" height="600">
            </a>
        </div>
        <br />
